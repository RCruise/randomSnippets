# I have no experience with Kubernetes but over the weekend I took interest in it so I took a crash course in 
# Kubernetes 101, and read other sources of tutorials about Kubernetes including github and youtube and udemy.
# After learning the basic things, I installed Virtual Box and UBUNTU OS on my laptop and installed Kubernetes, 
# minikube and other prerequisites,so I can actually see it in action. 
# Unfortunately, I am still having issues with the nested VMs that is supposed to create a Kubernetes cluster
# I've been reading some blogs but no luck at this point. 
# Anyway, granted it get started, This is how I will deploy on a test Kubernetes cluster


# I used kvm2 as the virtual machine for the cluster (tried both virtual box and kvm2)
$  minikube start --vm-driver kvm2


# assuming I have already created a container "weather-forecast"  
# Deploy it
$ kubectl run weather-forecast --image=weather-forecast:v1 --port=8080
$ kubectl expose deployment weather-forecast


# check the deployment
$ kubectl get deployments

# check whether the pod is up and running
$ kubectl get pod
# Expected output
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-forecast-3383150820-vctvh      1/1      Running   0          2s

# Once it is up and running, we can now use Curl to access it.
#Expected output:
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-forecast-3383150820-vctvh        1/1      Running   0          12s
$ curl $(minikube service weather-forecast --url)



# Once done
$ kubectl delete services weather-forecast

# delete the pod
$ kubectl delete deployment weather-forecast

# Stop the Cluster
$ minikube stop
